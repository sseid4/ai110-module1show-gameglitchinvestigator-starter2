# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start
  (for example: "the hints were backwards").
* The game looked like less engaging and the layout out and setup were rondom instead of being user intiution friendly. _ Three bugs I noticed were that the hints were backwards, the new game flow sometimes got stuck, and difficulty behavior felt inconsistent.

**Bug Reproduction Log**

Document at least 3 bugs you found. Add rows as needed.

| Input | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Console Output / Error |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Guess higher than the secret | Show "Go LOWER!" | Showed "Go HIGHER!" | None |
| Guess lower than the secret | Show "Go HIGHER!" | Showed "Go LOWER!" | None |
| Click New Game in Hard mode | Use Hard range | Used the default range | None |

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)?

I used copilot

- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was correct (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).

Correct suggestion: Copilot suggested storing the secret number in st.session_state and only creating it once, instead of recreating it on reruns. This was correct because the secret stopped changing every time I clicked Submit. I verified it by opening Developer Debug Info and watching the secret stay stable until New Game or difficulty change.

- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was incorrect or misleading (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).

Incorrect/misleading suggestion: one AI-generated version used mixed types by turning the secret into a string on some attempts, which caused unreliable comparisons. This was misleading because it made win checks inconsistent depending on attempt flow. I verified the problem by reading the code path and then confirming the fix with targeted pytest regression tests.

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?

I treated a bug as fixed only when both manual gameplay and automated tests matched expected behavior. I checked the game UI and Developer Debug Info to make sure state and hints behaved consistently. If either manual behavior or tests disagreed, I kept iterating.

- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)
  and what it showed you about your code.

  I ran PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q and used tests that specifically check reversed hints, difficulty ranges, parse errors, and mixed-type secret handling. These tests showed the logic functions now return the expected outcomes and messages. I also manually changed difficulty and started a new game to confirm state resets correctly.

- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?

Yes. Copilot helped propose regression-style tests for each fixed bug so I could verify behavior directly. It helped me map each gameplay issue to one function-level test in logic_utils.py behavior through tests/test_game_logic.py.

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?

I would say reruns are like replaying the whole script every click, and session_state is the memory that keeps values between those reruns.

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.

  I want to keep writing small regression tests right after each fix so I can quickly confirm bugs do not come back.

- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?

Next time I would ask AI for smaller, step-by-step changes and verify each one immediately instead of applying big edits at once.

- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.

This project showed me AI code can speed up development, but it still needs careful review and testing. I now treat AI output as a draft, not a final answer.
